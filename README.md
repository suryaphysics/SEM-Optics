# SEM-Optics
Defocus based phase retrieval of the electron probe wave function using focal series of probe intensities in SEM. 

~#### Description #####

All functions and code are annotated and commented well and are clear to understand when read with the main paper. It takes a decent computational capability to run this program quickly.

main_code.m - Run this code to execute the program

ASM_propagation.m - Propagation function based on the angular spectrum method

defocus_phase_retrieval.m - Function to perform iterative phase retrieval based on defocus variation

volt2wavelen.m - Function to calculate the relativistic wavelength from accelerating

psf_visualization.m - Function to visualize the PSF of SEM Optics based on recovered probe wavefunction

z_sampling.mat - z-locations (mm) of the specimen plane in the focal series

probe_intensity_focal_series - Folder containing probe intensity images named (0_PSF.png, +-1.png, ...), although they are named as PSF.png, but they are not to be confused with PSF of the SEM Optics, they are just probe intensity.

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: The probe intensity is loosely referred to as the PSF of SEM in SEM literature (inaccurate). We are visualizing the PSF of "SEM Optics - the lens system", which is a mathematically defined quantity.
